### 🧩 Fun-Fact

- To get the website preview working on Netlify, I deployed my project 8 times with some small changes. I knew that was not for any error - it was just for some unorganized or unnecessary code. After commenting out components one by one and redeploying after each change to find the issue. I found the issue: the imports in **App.jsx** were messy (like **Footer** on line 2, **Header** on line 5). Once I reorganized them properly and redeployed, the problem was fixed.
